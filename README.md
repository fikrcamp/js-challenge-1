## Javascript Fundementals Challenge One (Part One)💪🏾
#### Part 1:
Mohamed and Ali are tying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
> BMI = mass / height ** 2 
> BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

##### Your Task 😃:
1. Store Mohamed and Ali mass and heigh in variables
2. calculate both their BMIs using the formula
3. create a Boolean varaible `MohamedHigherBMI` containing information whether Mohamed has a higher BMI than Ali

Good Luck 😀
###### Test data
Data 1: Mohamed weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. Ali weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall
Data 2: Mohamed weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. Ali weights 85 kg and is 1.79 m tall
